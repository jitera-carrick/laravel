// Make sure to resolve any conflicts and ensure that the logic is correctly merged.

// Note: The placeholders above are replaced with the actual code from the new code block.
// The existing '/register' and '/login' routes are replaced with the new code provided.
// The '/login/cancel' route is updated to use the LoginController's cancelLogin method.
// The '/password/reset/request' route is updated with the new code for password reset request.
// The '/send_registration_email' route is updated with the new code for sending registration confirmation email.
// The commented out routes are left as is, since they are not present in the new code and it's unclear if they are needed.
// If they are needed, they should be uncommented and the logic should be merged with the new code.
